# URL Shortner 

URL shorteners are online tools that help to reduce the length of a URL, making it easier to remember and track. These services maintain a connection between the shortened link and the original URL, allowing anyone who clicks the new link to be redirected to the original page. URL shorteners have become increasingly popular with the rise of social media, where character limits and lengthy URLs can present a problem. Some popular URL shorteners include Bit.ly, Goog.le and Tinyurl.com.

Our Application is staring point to develop on top of this.
