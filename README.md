|1|[Converting Character to Integer](https://nitishhsinghhh.medium.com/converting-ascii-characters-to-numeric-values-a-fundamental-technique-for-arithmetic-and-fdd1e8a320c) | [C++](./ASCII/performingASCIIcalculations.cpp) | This program demonstrates how to convert characters to integers and calculate their sum.|
|2|[Input Validation](https://nitishhsinghhh.medium.com/converting-ascii-characters-to-numeric-values-a-fundamental-technique-for-arithmetic-and-fdd1e8a320c) | [C++](./ASCII/InputValidation.cpp) | This program prompts the user to input a number between 1 and 10, converts the input character to an integer, and checks if it is within the valid range. It then outputs a message indicating whether the input is valid or not.|
|3| [Simple Array](https://nitishhsinghhh.medium.com/linked-lists-vs-arrays-in-c-a-comprehensive-comparison-d94fbee74705) | [C++](./Array/SimpleArray.cpp) | This program demonstrates how to declare and initialize arrays in C++, and how to access their elements using the subscript operator. |'
|4| [Simple LinkedList](https://nitishhsinghhh.medium.com/linked-lists-vs-arrays-in-c-a-comprehensive-comparison-d94fbee74705) | [C++](./List/SimpleLinkedList.cpp) | This program demonstrates how to create and traverse a linked list using the Node struct, which contains an integer data value and a pointer to the next node in the list. |
|5| [Efficient Square Root ](https://nitishhsinghhh.medium.com/efficient-square-root-calculation-using-binary-search-in-c-106d30538aff) | [C++](./lgorithms/EfficientSquareRoot.cpp) | The program uses binary search to find the square root of a given number and returns the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the given number. |
|6| [1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c](https://nitishhsinghhh.medium.com/understanding-least-significant-bits-and-bit-flips-in-c-b6618f072b08) | [C++](./Leetcode/1318/Minimum%20Flips%20to%20Make%20a%20OR%20b%20Equal%20to%20c.cpp) |This is a C++ program that calculates the number of flips required to make all bits of three given integers either 0 or 1. |
|7| [Passing by Reference andÂ Value](https://nitishhsinghhh.medium.com/passing-by-reference-and-value-in-c-ea54ceba3b24) | [C++](./PassBYValueReference/modifyValues.cpp) |This is a C++ program that demonstrates the difference between passing a variable by value and by reference. |
|8| [Lexicographic Order](https://nitishhsinghhh.medium.com/understanding-lexicographic-order-in-programming-with-c-6d283dce5233) | [C++](./Lexicographic%20Order/sortingsearchinggeneratingpermutations.cpp) | This C++ program demonstrates the usage of lexicographic order by comparing strings and sorting a vector of strings. It also shows how to generate permutations of a vector of integers using the next_permutation function. |
